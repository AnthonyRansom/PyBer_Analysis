# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The analysis of the Pyber Ride data will provide insight on the weekly fare income for the various types of cities Pyber operates.
The results of the analysis will look into how the weekly fares differ between Urban, Suburban and Rural cities and compare the results to the number
of Drivers and Number of Rides for each city type.

Through the insights gained from this analysis multiple business cases will be presented in order to advise on how Pyber can improve
business in the relevant city sectors.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Review of Fare Summary

![Summary Table](/analysis/PyBer_summary.PNG)

From the summary data table certain patterns have be noted:
 - The average fare per driver and average fare per ride increases in less populated areas such as Rural areas compared to more densely populated areas such as Urban areas
 - More densely populated areas indicate an increase in rides but also shows higher competition in the number of drivers operating in the Urban city areas.

With further review of the summary, the provided dataset shows the number of rides and the total fares in each city type increases as there are more drivers present
but the data does indicate that Urban areas have more drivers than the number of rides for the period analysed which may indicate too many drivers have been 
allocated to Urban city areas which is reducing the average fare per driver.


### Review of Weekly Fare by City Type Graph

![Total Fare by City Type Graph](/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

Looking at the provided graph shows the weekly fare by city type matches the summary table above with the Total fares for Urban areas showing the highest weekly fare total followed by Suburban and then Rural.
The following has been determined from looking at the three graphs for the various city types:
 - The Urban graph indicates there is a slow increase in the fares starting from January, peaking at around the end of February with steep weekly fluctuations throughout the month of March.
 
 - The Urban graph shows a steady decline in Fares starting the middle of April but there is not enough data to determine if the decline continues or is temporary.
 
 - The Suburban graph shows a similar increase in weekly fares starting from January similiar to the Urban graph.
 
 - The Suburban graph shows a steady weekly fare through the Months of January to April but there is large increase in weekly fares in the last weeks of March
	aligning with the same noticable spike on the Rural and Urban graphs.
	
 - The Rural graph shows some steep fluctuations for the fares for each week but the weekly fares are maintained within the 0$ to $500 bracket through the Months of January to April.
	
 - The graphs for the three city types indicate a consistent weekly fares income within a $1,000 range for each city type

## Summary

The analysis from the graph indicates the City Types maintain a fairly consistent Fare income but there are some disparities between the various city types shown on the summary table.
The below business cases will propose some solutions in order to resolve these disparities across the city types:

### Business Case 1
The data shows a high number of drivers compared to the number of rides in Urban areas causing the average fare per driver to decrease. Pyber could look at reducing the number of drivers in Urban cities
in order to resolve the disparity between the number of rides vs the number of drivers in Urban cities compared to Suburban and Rural areas.

### Business Case 2
The data shows there are less people taking rides in Rural and Suburban areas but the average fare per ride is higher which could indicate the rides are longer compared to Urban areas.
It may be beneficial to decrease the fare price in Rural and Suburban areas which will encourage more people to make use of the service with the aim to increase demand which in turn will increase the number of drivers
aligning the Total fare income and number of rides and drivers with the Urban city areas.

### Business Case 3
Accoring to the graph data the weekly fares for Urban abd Suburban the month of January start with decreased weekly fares compared to the rest of the year.
Advertising campaigns or promotional specials offers and discounts could be planned for the December and January periods in order to promote use of the PyBer service during these periods.
